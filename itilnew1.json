The effect of automation is to increase self-service, not to decrease it.\n\"With increased automation, AI, robotic process automation (RPA), and chatbots,\nservice desks are moving to provide more self-service logging and resolution\ndirectly via online portals and mobile applications\".&nbsp;</div><div>C. <b style=\"color:red;\">Incorrect</b>.
