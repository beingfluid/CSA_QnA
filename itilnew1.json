          "explaination": "A. <b style=\"color:green;\">Correct</b>. \"With increased automation… The impact on service desks is reduced\nphone contact, less low-level work, and a greater ability to focus on excellent CX\nwhen personal contact is needed\". Ref 5.2.14&nbsp;<div>B. <b style=\"color:red;\">Incorrect</b>. The effect of automation is to increase self-service, not to decrease it.\n\"With increased automation, AI, robotic process automation (RPA), and chatbots,\nservice desks are moving to provide more self-service logging and resolution\ndirectly via online portals and mobile applications\". Ref 5.2.14&nbsp;</div><div>C. <b style=\"color:red;\">Incorrect</b>. The opposite is true. \"With increased automation and the gradual\nremoval of technical debt, the focus of the service desk is to provide support for\n‘people and business’ rather than simply technical issues\". Ref 5.2.14&nbsp;</div><div>D. <b style=\"color:red;\">Incorrect</b>. The use of automation will not eliminate the need to escalate incidents.\n\"A key point to be understood is that, no matter how efficient the service desk and\nits people are, there will always be issues that need escalation and underpinning\nsupport from other teams\".
